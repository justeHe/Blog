## Preface
Three years ago, after learning the front-end trio (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), I always wanted to build a personal blog. However, due to a lack of time, this project was indefinitely postponed. Recently, while browsing GitHub, I came across some interesting front-end themes, which reignited my blog plan. This blog is primarily built using the [butterfly](https://github.com/jerryc127/hexo-theme-butterfly) template. Below, I will share the tools and resource sites used in building this blog.

## Server
The [server](https://cloud.tencent.com/act/campus?fromSource=gwzcw.7502004.7502004.7502004&utm_medium=cpc&utm_id=gwzcw.7502004.7502004.7502004&bd_vid=11264964216929139476) is a student discount from Tencent Cloud, which is quite affordable and can be renewed for three years, making it sufficient for building a personal blog. However, domain registration can be a bit troublesome. If you don't want a server, you can use GitHub's GitHub Pages as a server, but the downside is that it can only be used for static pages, which is sufficient for a personal blog. For panel management, I used Baota, which is a conventional choice.

## Interface

### Homepage
The homepage uses a [fluid simulation](https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation) effect, [try it out](https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/)
